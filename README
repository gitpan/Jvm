Jvm - Java Virtual Machine Extension Version 0.9.1

This is a Perl 5 extension to Java Virtual Machine. Document is in 
Jvm.pm, run 'perldoc Jvm.pm' to read it.

Current version is just an alpha version, and it only supports Sun 
JDK1.3 beta right now.

Before you install the module on your box, please run 'make test' 
to perform a comprehensive test. The 'test.pl' has some examples, 
which can be used as demos on how to manipulate Java Jvm.

I just tested the package on my personal computer, I will try to
make the package support as more different environment as possible.
So, if you have any trouble with this package, please feel free
let me know.
